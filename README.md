# Planes

A game that I used to play with pen on paper, redone to be played against the computer. The goal is to take down your enemy's three planes before yours are taken down. Deduction skills and also knowledge of how to best place your planes in the beggining are crucial.\
The computer is powered by a minmax algorithm that has been through a few revisions and is now able to put up a decent fight against the player.\
Further instructions on gameplay are presented at the beginning of the game. To run it, the command 'python start.py' can be run at the root of the project.
